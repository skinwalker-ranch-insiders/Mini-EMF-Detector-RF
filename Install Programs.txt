Installing Nginx on a Debian Pi:
	sudo apt-get update
	sudo apt-get upgrade
	
	sudo apt-get install nginx			(Webserver)
	
Installing PHP-FPM on a Debian Pi:
	sudo apt-get php7.4-fpm
	
Configuring Nginx to work with PHP 7.4 FPM:
	sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/default
	
	Find the line that says the following:
		index index.html index.htm index.nginx-debian.html;
		
	Add index.php after the word index.
		index index.php index.html index.htm index.nginx-debian.html;
		
	Make sure the following lines are uncommented:
		location / {
				try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
		}
		
	Remove the comment from the following lines:
		include snippets/fastcgi-php.conf;
		fastcgi_pass unix:/run/php/php7.4-fpm.sock;
		
sudo nginx -t (This checks the nginx config files to make sure that are correct.)
sudo systemctl restart nginx
sudo chmod -R 777 /var/www/html	(This is where your index.php file will live.)
sudo nano /var/www/html/index.php
	<?php
	phpinfo();
	?>
	
	Save the file.
